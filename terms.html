                <h2>15. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                
                <h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
                <p>Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at <a href="mailto:devvrat.coding@gmail.com">devvrat.coding@gmail.com</a>. We'll try to resolve disputes in good faith.</p>

                <h3>Arbitration (if applicable)</h3>
                <p>If informal resolution fails, disputes may be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except where prohibited by law. Arbitration is:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Conducted by a neutral arbitrator</li>
                  <li>More informal and less expensive than court litigation</li>
                  <li>Final and binding (limited grounds for appeal)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p>To the extent permitted by law, you agree that disputes will be resolved on an individual basis and not as a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.</p>
