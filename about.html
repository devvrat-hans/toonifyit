            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At Toonifyit, we're dedicated to making LLM interactions more efficient and cost-effective. We believe that data format optimization shouldn't be complicated, which is why we created a simple, fast, and privacy-focused JSON to TOON converter.</p>

          <section class="policy__section">
            <h2>What is TOON?</h2>
            <p>TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) is a data serialization format specifically designed for large language model prompts. It reduces token usage by 30-60% compared to traditional JSON while maintaining readability and structure.</p>

          <section class="policy__section">
            <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
            <p>As developers working with LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude, we constantly faced the challenge of token limits and costs. Traditional JSON was eating up our token budgets, especially when dealing with large datasets or API responses.</p>
            <p>We discovered TOON format and realized its potential, but there wasn't a simple, accessible tool to convert between JSON and TOON. That's why we built Toonifyit - to make this powerful optimization technique available to everyone.</p>
